This is project is a simple implement of AES-256 with GCM mode. Test code in "main.c" can give you a straightforward
example of how to use the encryption and decryption functions.

The way of the implementation in this project is corresponding to the definition of standard files. So this code may be
useful for someone who want to learn AES and GCM mode with code.

It is needed to emphasized that, this project is only for learning. Therefore, this code is slow and maybe unsafe.
If you want an AES function for your business, professional crypto library such as OpenSSL is your need.
